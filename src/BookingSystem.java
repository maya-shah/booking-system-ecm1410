import java.util.ArrayList;

//1. The booking system is responsible for most functionalities. It has a list of bookable rooms, a list of assistants on
//shift, and a list of bookings.
//2. This class must be able to manage general functionalities on these lists, i.e., you should implement functions to
//add, remove, and to show bookable rooms, assistants on shift, and bookings.
//3. There is a time-slot concept that will guide the booking system. For instance, rooms will be available, and
//assistants will work at a specific time-slot, i.e., date, time and duration. Hence, tests should be booked at
//available slots.
//4. Every time-slot has a fixed duration â€“ a positive number representing the duration of a test, in minutes. This
//quantity includes the time spent doing the test and the time to sanitize the room. The current policy establishes
//this duration to be 60 minutes.
